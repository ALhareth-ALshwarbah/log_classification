# log_classification 

## The content of this repo

This is a python package that takes a log file and classify it

based on 5 LOG levels: (**DEBUG** / **INFO** / **WARNING** / **ERROR** / **CRITICAL**)

and you can choose the level that you want to classify based on

and when you choose the level a file will be created in the path that you specify,ex:

``` powershell
debug.log | info.log | warning.log | error.log | critical.log
```

and this classification is based on a certain regex , ex:

``` powershell
[2025-10-15 09:00:01] DEBUG    Starting system diagnostics for user: dev_admin

[2025-10-15 09:00:09] INFO     Application startup complete

- ``` --err ``` for ERROR

- ``` --cri ``` for CRITICAL

Examples:

``` powershell
C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop\Classify [master] > act 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop\example.log' 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop' --de
the debug.log has been created and filled with the debug data
```

``` powershell
C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop > act 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop\example.log' 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop' --inf

```

```powershell
C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop > act 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop\example.log' 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop' --war
the warning.log has been created and filled with the warning data

```powershell
C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop > act 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop\example.log' 'C:\Users\Ghost\Desktop' --err
